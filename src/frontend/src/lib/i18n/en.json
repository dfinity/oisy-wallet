Data Controller\n\nData protection laws in certain jurisdictions, including Switzerland (“**CH**”), the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”) and the United Kingdom (“**UK**”), recognise the role of “controller” – the organisation which decides why and how to process personal data.\n\nDFINITY will act as a controller for the personal data processed through the Sites.\n\nThe use of personal data is required for the provision of the OISY Wallet services. For further details of the personal data we collect, please see the table below.\n\nYou provide us with personal data directly when you create an account/set up an OISY Wallet with us, or contact us for information about our Sites. We also create some personal data ourselves, including measuring of your OISY Wallet activity (to help us improve the Sites and allow you to benefit from our rewards programmes (e.g. Sprinkles).\n\nIn the EEA / UK we are required by law to always have a permitted reason or justification (called a “lawful basis”) for processing your personal data. There are six permitted lawful bases for processing standard personal data. In the event that we process special category personal data (for example your biometric data), we are required to have a further lawful basis to process such data lawfully.\n\nIn CH, we are generally not required to have a specific legal basis for processing your personal data, provided that such processing is not unlawful. This means in particular that it must not violate your personality rights and must comply with the principles set out in the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP). However, where we process special category personal data (for example your biometric data), we must have a justification under Swiss law. In most cases, this means that your explicit consent is required for such processing to be lawful. For the purposes of the table below, any reference to a \"lawful basis\" should be understood as a corresponding \"justification\" under Swiss law.\n\nThe table below explains the different purposes for which we process your personal data, some of which may be considered sensitive depending on your jurisdiction, and the relevant lawful basis or bases on which we rely for that processing.\n\n| Purposes for processing personal data | Type of personal data we use for this | Our lawful basis |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Creating or logging into your OISY Wallet | “Internet Identity number” - this is your unique identifier for accessing OISY Wallet FaceID, TouchID (both of which rely on processing of your biometric data), or security key | Performance of a contract with you; and Your explicit consent for processing of biometric data in jurisdictions where it is deemed sensitive (where you have chosen to complete the sign-in verification using your biometric data through FaceID or TouchID). |\n| **User support and troubleshooting** – communicating with you to solve any queries or problems you might be experiencing as well as to provide technical updates to you | Name Email Address Discord User ID / display name Details of any issues you report | Performance of a contract with you; or Our legitimate interests in ensuring appropriate service levels for our users |\n| Feedback to improve user experience and inform Site development | Discord User ID / display name Any feedback you provide to our feedback channels | Our legitimate interests in developing the Site and informing our strategy |\n| Facilitating our rewards/loyalty schemes | Your account/wallet log-in activity Your transaction volumes/frequency | Our legitimate interests in developing and growing our services and promoting future use of the Sites |\n| Facilitating the Refer Your Friends scheme | Your unique referral code Account/wallet log-in activity associated with your referrals Transaction volumes/frequency of your referrals | Our legitimate interests in developing and growing our services and promoting future use of the Sites |\n| To provide you with our promotional/marketing updates (where you have subscribed) | Name Email Address Discord User ID / display name | Where you have provided your Consent |\n| **Measuring and improving Site performance** | Device/browser type and operating system; IP address and session metadata; Usage logs and authentication attempts [Geo-location data] | Our legitimate interest to optimize the performance of our Sites |\n| Handling media enquiries (where you contact us as a member of the media) | Name Email Address Details of your enquiry | Our legitimate interests in ensuring a strong working relationship with the media and promotion of the Site |\n\n\nThe personal data we hold about you may additionally be converted into aggregated and anonymized data which we will use for the purpose of data analytics, product development and to improve our services, for our business purposes, including the data listed at “Measuring and improving Site performance”.\n\nWe do not knowingly collect the information of children. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete the information. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child, please contact us via the methods listed below.\n\n### 2. Data Sharing\n\nWe may share your data with other DFINITY entities/members of our group, service providers and selected third parties (e.g. business partners), for purposes of providing our services to you and in connection with our efforts to prevent and investigate fraudulent activity.\n\n### 3. Data Retention\n\nWe will store your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the performance of our obligations or to achieve the purposes for which your personal data was collected, or as may be permitted under applicable law.  When determining the appropriate length of time for retention, multiple factors are taken into account, including: the nature and sensitivity of the personal information; the purposes for which the information is required; any laws or regulations that we are required to follow; and the period of time during which any claims or proceedings can be brought against us to defend against any such claims.\n\nThis means that typically we retain your personal data for the duration of your relationship with us and then, for a period defined by legal, accounting or reporting requirements. If you would like further information on our retention periods, please reach out to us through the details in the “Contact” section below for further information.\n\n### 4. Transfers from UK/EEA/CH\n\nWe store your personal data in Switzerland and other locations where our employees and contractors work, including the United States.\n\nIn the course of providing our services, we will need to transfer personal data to locations outside the jurisdiction in which you provide it or where you are viewing or using our Sites. If you are based in the UK,EEA or CH, this will mean that your personal data may be transferred to, accessible from, and/or stored at, a destination outside the UK/EEA/CH in which data protection laws may not be as comprehensive as in the UK/EEA/CH.\n\nRegardless of the location of our processing, we will impose the same data protection safeguards that we deploy inside the UK/EEA/CH and implement appropriate measures to ensure that your personal data is protected in accordance with applicable data protection laws.\n\nSimilarly, where a third-party service provider processes the personal data of EEA, UK or CH residents on our behalf, we will ensure that appropriate measures are in place to ensure an adequate level of protection for your personal data.\n\nIf any of our processing activities require your personal data to be transferred from within the UK, EEA or CH to outside the UK/EEA/CH, we will only make that transfer if:\n- the country to which the personal data is to be transferred ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data;\n- we have put in place appropriate safeguards to protect your personal data, such as an appropriate contract with the recipient;\n- the transfer is necessary for one of the reasons specified in data protection legislation, such as the performance of a contract between us and you; or\n- you explicitly consent to the transfer.\n\nPlease contact us as directed below in the “Contact” section if you would like to see a copy of the specific safeguards applied to the export of your personal data.\n\n### 5. Third Party Links\n\nThe Sites may contain third party links to other sites, such as Discord and our project partners. Please be aware that where these sites are not operated by DFINITY we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave this website and to read the privacy statements applicable on those sites. This privacy notice does not apply to information that is collected on third parties’ sites.\n\n### 6. OISY Sprinkles\n\nActive wallets are eligible for OISY Sprinkles, OISY’s rewards program. You may win Sprinkles based on daily use and referrals, or other criteria. Sprinkles are deposited directly into your wallet therefore you are only eligible to receive Sprinkles if you have an OISY account.\n\nOISY does not partner with third parties to reward Sprinkles. OISY does not process your sensitive personal data to administer the OISY Sprinkles program. OISY does not sell or process for purposes of targeted advertising personal data collected for purposes of the OISY Sprinkles program.\n\n### 7. Automated decision making\n\nWe do not currently use, and do not anticipate using, any automated decision making in relation to your personal data (i.e. where decisions are made by a computer only without human interaction). If this changes, we will update this notice.\n\n### 8. User Rights,  Questions and Comments\n\nUnder certain circumstances, including if you are a resident of the UK/EEA/CH, or of Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, or Oregon, by law you may have the right to:\n- **Request access to your personal data** (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may also have the right to obtain a list of categories of third parties that we have disclosed your personal information to.\n- **Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.** This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected. We may delete the contested personal information as an alternative to correcting the information if the deletion of the personal information does not negatively impact you, or you consent to the deletion.\n- **Request erasure of your personal data.** This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no legal basis for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).\n- **Object to processing of your personal data.** You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.\n- **Object to any automated decision-making including profiling** and request human decision making for that same processing instead (i.e. request not to be subject of any automated decision-making by us using your personal data or profiling of you).\n- **Request the restriction of processing of your personal data.** This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.\n- **Request transfer of your personal data in an electronic and structured form to you or to another party** (commonly known as a right to “data portability”). Subject to certain conditions and to the extent feasible, you may be entitled to receive the personal data in a usable format that allows you to transmit the data to another entity.\n- **Right to withdraw consent.** Where we rely on consent as our legal basis for processing you may withdraw consent at any time by contacting us at support@oisy.com (Note: this does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal). We must stop processing your personal data unless there is another lawful basis upon which we can rely, in which case we would let you know.\n- **<u>Right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of personal information (for US residents).</u>** We currently do not sell personal information to third parties, therefore we do not offer this right. We may share personal information about you with service providers as permitted by law.\n- **<u>Right to opt</u>-out of processing for purposes of targeted advertising <u>(for US residents)</u>.** We currently do not engage in targeted advertising, therefore we do not offer this right.\n- <u>**Right to limit the use, disclosure, or processing of your sensitive personal information (for US residents).** This enables you to ask that we not use, disclose, or process your sensitive personal information.</u>\n\nWhere our processing of your personal data is necessary for our legitimate interests, you can object to this processing at any time. If you do this, we will need to show either a compelling reason why our processing should continue, which overrides your interests, rights and freedoms or that the processing is necessary for us to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.\n\nPlease note, the rights listed above are not absolute and so may be subject to restrictions or may not be available in your jurisdiction. We do not discriminate against you if you choose to exercise any of these rights.\n\nFor US residents: Please note that depending on your jurisdiction, we are only obligated to respond, free of cost, to personal information requests from the same consumer up to two times in a 12-month period. Depending on your jurisdiction, after you have exceeded the applicable number of requests, we have the right to charge a reasonable fee for fulfilling the request. In addition, under the applicable state privacy law, and for the protection of your personal information, we may be limited in what personal information we can disclose.\n\nYou may exercise your rights by contacting us at support@oisy.com. We must verify your identity before fulfilling your personal information request.\n\nDepending on your jurisdiction, you also may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.  If you are submitting a request through an authorized agent, the authorized agent must provide us with your signed written permission stating that the agent is authorized to make the request on your behalf.  Alternatively, your authorized agent may provide evidence of having power of attorney or acting as a conservator for you.\n\nIf you feel that your data has not been handled correctly, or you are unhappy with our response to any requests you have made to us regarding the use of your personal data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a complaint with a competent authority.\n\nIf you are based in the UK, the competent authority is the Information Commissioner’s Office.\n\nYou can contact them by calling 0303 123 1113, or go online to [www.ico.org.uk/concerns](http://www.ico.org.uk/concerns) (opens in a new window; please note we can't be responsible for thecontent of external websites).\n\nIf you are based outside the UK, you have the right to lodge your complaint with the relevant data protection regulator in your country of residence.\n\nIf you are based in Switzerland, the competent authority is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.\n\nYou can contact them online at www.edoeb.admin.ch (opens in a new window; please note we can't be responsible for the content of external websites). Please note that under Swiss law, there is no formal right to lodge a complaint, but you may report a potential data protection violation to the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.\n\nHowever, please be aware that you will not be able to exercise rights or raise complaints to us for data processed in blockchains or in connection with third party services, as they are not controlled by us or our affiliates. Because blockchains are decentralized and third party services are not controlled or operated by us or our affiliates, we are not able to control, erase, modify, or alter personal data processed during the use of such blockchain technologies\n\n### 9. Changes to This Policy\n\nWe may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, at our discretion, and we may post new versions on our Site,  after which we will update the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We therefore encourage you to check the Privacy Policy for such updates on a regular basis.\n\n### 10.
