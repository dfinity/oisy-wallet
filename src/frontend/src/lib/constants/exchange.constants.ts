 * CoinGecko's public API offers cached values updated every 60 seconds (or every 30 seconds for Pro API users).
 * The CoinGecko Public API imposes a rate limit of 5 to 15 calls per minute, depending on global usage conditions.
 *
 * While the limitations of Coingecko appeared suitable for our initial use case involving two calls (ETH and ERC20), in practice, we've observed that Coingecko frequently generates errors.
 * As a result, we've restricted synchronization to a once-per-minute refresh.
