/**
 * This function checks whether the Index canister is not in a "sleepy" state (not syncing new blocks from the Ledger canister).
 *
 * When the Index canister is low on cycles, it may happen that it does not sync new blocks from the Ledger canister.
 * However, it does not return an error, it just provides a zero balance and empty transactions (as per our experience).
 *
 * In these cases, we can check if the Index canister is sleepy by comparing its balance with the Ledger canister balance.
 * There is a small delay between the Ledger canister and the Index canister, so we wait for 5 seconds before checking again.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<boolean>} Whether the Index canister is awake.
