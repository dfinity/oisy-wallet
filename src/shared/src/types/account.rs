//! Account identifiers.
//!
//! An account identifier applies to a token standard.  For example, currently on the Internet
//! Computer, the token standard ICRC-1 specifies how to communicate with a token ledger and what
//! account identifiiers look like.  The same standard applies to native ICP, SNS tokens, and more.
//!
//! Similarly, EVM tokens use EVM addresses as account identifiers.  This applies to native ETH but
//! also to all ERC20 tokens.

    /// help you save money on transaction fees when moving your bitcoin around.

    /// identified by a prefix of bc1q and a character length of exactly 42.

    /// While P2WPKH and P2WSH are known as Segwit V0, P2TR is considered Segwit V1. Notably, P2TR
    /// utilizes a digital signature algorithm called Schnorr, which differs from the ECDSA format

    /// including additional transaction fee reductions and increased privacy.
    ///
    /// Regarding privacy, the key and signature aggregations made possible by Schnorr allow
    /// multisig addresses to be indistinguishable from singlesig, and the full spending conditions
    /// for a P2TR address are not necessarily revealed publicly. The creator of the address can
    /// even include multiple customized redeem scripts to choose from in order to spend the
    /// bitcoin later.
