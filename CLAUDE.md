# CLAUDE.md

Claude-specific runtime layer. Anything not contradicted here defers to
[`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md), which is the canonical entry for **all** agents.

> **Mandatory first step:** read [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md). Then read the
> matching area README before touching code:
>
> - Frontend → [`docs/ai/frontend/README.md`](./docs/ai/frontend/README.md)
> - Backend → [`docs/ai/backend/README.md`](./docs/ai/backend/README.md)

## Reasoning preferences

- **Plan briefly, then act.** For non-trivial work (>1 file or >50 lines), lay
  out a 3–6 step plan in plain text before editing files. Keep it tight.
- **Targeted edits.** Use `StrReplace` / `EditNotebook`-style precise edits.
  Never rewrite an entire file when 5 lines change.
- **Explore in parallel.** Batch independent reads / greps / globs in a single
  tool turn. Don't serialize what can be parallel.
- **Stop and ask** if a request is ambiguous about scope, atomicity, or
  policy — better one extra question than a sprawling PR. Especially before:
  - Adding a new dependency (npm or Cargo).
  - Adding a new top-level folder.
  - Touching `backend.did`, generated `declarations/`, or stable state.

## Coding rules (Claude-specific addenda)

These are on top of the [10 commandments](./AGENTS.md#2-the-10-commandments-read-before-every-change):

- **Read before edit.** Always read a file (or its relevant range) at least
  once before modifying it. The `Read` / `Grep` tools are cheap.
- **Run quality gates.** Before declaring done, run from the repo root:

  ```bash
  # Frontend
  npm run format
  npm run lint -- --max-warnings 0
  npm run check
  npm run test

  # Backend (only if Rust files changed)
  ./scripts/format.sh
  ./scripts/lint.rust.sh
  ./scripts/lint.did.sh
  ./scripts/test.backend.sh   # heavy — see docs/ai/backend/testing.md
  ```

  Fix everything you broke. Don't leave broken state for the human.

- **Reuse over rebuild.** Before creating a new `.svelte` / `.utils.ts` /
  `.constants.ts` / Rust module, search for an existing one. See
  [`docs/ai/frontend/reusability.md`](./docs/ai/frontend/reusability.md) and
  [`docs/ai/backend/patterns.md`](./docs/ai/backend/patterns.md).
- **No new dependencies** without explicit user approval (npm or Cargo).
- **No new top-level folders** under `src/frontend/src/` or `src/backend/src/`.
  The taxonomies in
  [`docs/ai/frontend/structure.md`](./docs/ai/frontend/structure.md) and
  [`docs/ai/backend/structure.md`](./docs/ai/backend/structure.md) are closed;
  surface a question instead of inventing a bucket.
- **Comments are for _why_, not _what_.** No narrating comments
  ("// fetch the user"). Only write a comment if it captures intent,
  trade-off, or an invariant the code can't express.
- **Never bypass the eslint / clippy disallowed-rule lists.** They encode
  hard policy (e.g. `console.error` → `consoleError`, `0n` → `ZERO`,
  `std::print*` → `ic_cdk::print*`). See
  [`eslint.config.mjs`](./eslint.config.mjs) and
  [`clippy.toml`](./clippy.toml).
- **Never push force / amend pushed commits / rewrite shared history.** Add
  a new commit instead. Approval of a broader task (e.g. "do what you
  think is best", "make the most correct one", "do it your way") is
  **NOT** approval to force-push — the user must name the operation
  directly using any unambiguous phrasing (e.g. "force-push", "force
  push", "push --force", "push -f", "amend", "git commit --amend",
  "rebase", "git rebase", "rewrite history"), or pick a multi-choice
  option whose label contains one of those phrases. When in doubt, add
  a new commit. See
  [`docs/ai/pr-and-ci.md#updating-an-existing-pr`](./docs/ai/pr-and-ci.md#updating-an-existing-pr).

## Tool-use cheatsheet

| Goal                          | Use                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Find files by name            | `Glob`                                      |
| Find code by exact text/regex | `Grep` (prefer over shell `rg`)             |
| Find code by meaning          | `SemanticSearch`                            |
| Read a file                   | `Read` (NOT `cat` / `head` / `tail`)        |
| Edit a file                   | `StrReplace` (NOT `sed` / `awk` / heredocs) |
| Run a one-shot command        | `Shell`                                     |
| Multi-step exploration        | `Task` with `subagent_type: "explore"`      |

## Coordination

- For role-based collaboration with other agents (planner / implementer /
  reviewer), follow [`docs/ai/governance.md`](./docs/ai/governance.md).
- For PR title, scope, body and CI gates, follow
  [`docs/ai/pr-and-ci.md`](./docs/ai/pr-and-ci.md).
- For meta-updates (changing the rules themselves), follow the
  [meta-update rule](./docs/ai/governance.md#meta-update-rule).
