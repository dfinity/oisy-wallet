# XRP Ledger (XRPL) API

OISY reads XRP Ledger state over the **XRPL JSON-RPC API** (the interface
exposed by `rippled` / Clio nodes). This is the same HTTP JSON-RPC used across
the XRPL ecosystem; OISY talks to it with a plain `fetch` POST — there is no
XRPL SDK dependency.

XRP Ledger support ships **disabled by default** (`VITE_XRP_MAINNET_ENABLED`),
so none of the below is exercised in production until the feature is enabled.

## What we use it for

| Area    | Method         | Purpose                                                      |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Balance | `account_info` | Native XRP balance (in drops) for the user's classic address |

Later phases add `fee`, `submit` (send) and `account_tx` (history) — see the
[XRP integration spec](../spec-driven-development/specs/2026-07-24-feat-xrp-ledger-integration.md).

## Balance (`account_info`)

`loadXrpBalance` (`src/frontend/src/xrp/api/xrpl.api.ts`) POSTs

```json
{ "method": "account_info", "params": [{ "account": "r...", "ledger_index": "validated" }] }
```

and reads `result.account_data.Balance` — a string of **drops**
(1 XRP = 1,000,000 drops), returned as a `bigint`. An account that has never
been funded is not on-ledger and the node returns the `actNotFound` error; OISY
treats that as a **zero** balance (a valid state, not an error).

## Configuration

| Item            | Value                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RPC URL env var | `VITE_XRP_RPC_URL_MAINNET` (`src/frontend/src/env/networks/networks.xrp.env.ts`)                |
| Endpoint        | Selected per network by `xrpHttpRpcUrl` (`src/frontend/src/xrp/providers/xrp-rpc.providers.ts`) |
| Dev fallback    | `https://xrplcluster.com` (XRP Ledger Foundation public cluster)                                |

## Provider choice

For production, `VITE_XRP_RPC_URL_MAINNET` must point at a **managed provider**
endpoint. [QuickNode](./quicknode.md) already offers full XRPL RPC (Clio,
mainnet + testnet) and OISY already has a QuickNode account, so it is the
expected provider; the endpoint hostname is provisioned per account and set via
the env var.

The public clusters (`xrplcluster.com`, `s1.ripple.com`, `s2.ripple.com`) are
used only as a **development fallback**. Per
[xrpl.org](https://xrpl.org/docs/tutorials/public-servers) they are explicitly
**not for sustained or production use** and may become unavailable at any time.
